# ReduxSimpleStarter

Interested in learning [Redux](https://www.udemy.com/react-redux/)?

### Getting Started

There are two methods for getting started with this repo.

#### Familiar with Git?
Checkout this repo, install dependencies, then start the transpiling process with the following:

```
> git clone https://github.com/lebaz20/ReduxSimpleStarter.git
> cd ReduxSimpleStarter
> yarn install
> yarn start
```

Note that `yarn start` starts a server with hot reloading option to be able to see your changes on the browser with a simple browser refresh.
However, If you just want to generate your `bundle.js` without starting a dev server, Just run:

```
> yarn build
```
